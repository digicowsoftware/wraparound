		<p><span class="subtitle">What Wraparound Does:</span> Wraparound eases mouse-cursor navigation by "wrapping" the cursor from one side of the screen to the other when it reaches the edge of the screen. Wraparound handles all screen configurations: small, large, multiple, even combinations of monitors and televisions.</p>
		<p><span class="subtitle">What Wraparound Does Not Do:</span> Wraparound does not "hack" the system at a low level. Wraparound runs as a normal Mac OS X application, so there are some (normally unnoticable) limitations of its operation, but also the peace of mind of knowing it's never doing anything that can't be stopped by simply quitting the application. Wraparound also does not alter the display, so there is no way that windows can mimic the mouse cursor behavior, wrapping from one side of the screen to the other, straddling the edge. This is particularly noticable for multiple monitor users.</p>
		<hr />
		<p><span class="subtitle">How to use Wraparound</span><br />
		Wraparound begins wrapping immediately when the application is launched, unless it is in disabled status (more on that later). There are two main aspects of its user interface: the menu bar icon &amp; menu, and the Preferences window. The former displays Wraparound's current enabled status, allows you to temporarily stop and restart Wraparound's wrapping function, display the Preferences window, and quit Wraparound. The Preferences window offers a variety of choices and options to customize Wraparound's behavior. There are four ways to cause the Preferences window to be displayed: <ul><li>launch Wraparound with the "Show this window automatically" option checked (this is the default)</li><li>launch Wraparound while holding down the option key</li><li>double-click Wraparound's Finder icon while Wraparound is running</li><li>choose Preferences from the Wraparound menu</li></ul></p>
		<p><span class="subtitle">How to exit Wraparound</span><br />
		But why would you want to!? If you did come up with a good answer to this question, there are two main ways to exit Wraparound. The most common is to select Quit from the Wraparound menu. The other way is to press command-Q while in the Wraparound Preferences window.</p>
		<p><span class="subtitle">The Preferences Window</span><br />
		The preferences window is divided into three sections: Edges &amp; Hot Keys, Auto-Disable, and Settings.<br /><br />
		
		In the <span class="it">Edges &amp; Hot Keys section</span>, you can choose which edges of the screen the mouse cursor can pass through to wrap to the other side. With this version you are no longer limited to choices of Horizontal and Vertical: you can now choose any edge individually. This can even create one-way wrapping scenarios, for example so that you can wrap Up to get to the bottom of the screen, but not wrap Bottom so that you can unhide Dock. This section also allows you to set up modifier keys to temporarily enable or disable wrapping of all screen edges while holding that key.<br /><br />
		
		The <span class="it">Auto-Disable section</span> contains two main components that tell Wraparound when to stop wrapping under certain conditions. First are the familiar corner controls from previous Wraparound versions. Checking the "Near corners" box will prevent Wraparound from wrapping the mouse cursor when it is within that number of pixels of a screen corner. This is useful for hitting the corners to activate screensavers or expose. The second way to activate auto-disabling is through the Applications list. This allows you to have Wraparound automatically stop wrapping when you switch to certain applications, like games. You can use the popup menu to choose whether you want Wraparound to be enabled in all applications, disabled in certain applications, or disabled in all except certain applications. You need to have one of the latter two choices chosen in order to use the + and - buttons below the list, to modify its contents. As of this release, you cannot drop Applications from Finder onto this list, you must use the buttons.</p>
		
		Finally, the <span class="it">Settings section</span>, contains four checkboxes. These checkboxes respectively control whether or not Wraparound launches itself when you log into Mac OS X, displays the Preferences window when it launches, and shows the Wraparound icon and menu on the right side of the menu bar. This section also controls whether Wraparound checks for updates automatically, and provides a button to check manually.<br /><br />

		<a name="faq"><legend>F.A.Q.</legend></a>
		<div class="desctext">
			<span class="subtitle">Q. Why did you create Wraparound?</span>
			<p>A. I've been a dual-monitor user for many years. Once the screens get big enough, it can become annoying to constantly move the entire length of both screens to access certain elements, particularly the menu bar. Wraparound is inspired by an old Mac OS 9 and below extension that offered similar functionality. If anyone knows this extension or its author, please let me know, as I'd like to give credit in Wraparound</p>
			<span class="subtitle">Q. You mentioned limitations of Wraparound above. What are you referring to?</span>
			<p>A. Because Wraparound runs as a normal application, the wrapping function is not done at the mouse driver or display level. The main issue with this approach is that the last pixel of the screen on wrapped edges is "unreachable". Wraparound moves the cursor as soon as it discovers that it is on this pixel row or column, so if you require use of that row, you may have to arrive there by wrapping from the opposide side.</li></ul></p>
			<span class="subtitle">Q. Wow, this new version is exactly what I wanted. How can I show my appreciation?</span>
			<p>A. While Wraparound is distributed as freeware, donations are ALWAYS appreciated and inspire more work devoted to Digital Cow Software, which means more/better apps in the future. <a href="http://digicowsoftware.com/about?_s=buy">Donate!</a></p>
			<span class="subtitle">Q. How come my feature/help request was ignored?</span>
			<p>A. I've been getting a lot of email from users lately and while I want to respond to everyone individually, I don't have a lot of time between my day job and wedding preparations. If you haven't heard anything back from me, shoot me another email. I always enjoy hearing from my users!</p>
			<span class="subtitle">Q. What's in store for Wraparound in the future?</span>
			<p>A. A better user-interface that looks more professional, and offers more fine-grained control over some of Wraparound's options.</p>
